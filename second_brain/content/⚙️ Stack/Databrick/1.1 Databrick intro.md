**Two high level plane:**
1. Control Plane (databricks account)
	- web ui
	- Cluster management
	- workflows
	- Notebooks
2. Data plane (your own cloud account)
	- cluster VMs for compute
	- Storage

**Spark on Databricks**
- in-memory, distributed data processing
- support Scala, python, sql, r, java
- allow batch processing & stream processing
- structured, semi structured and unstructured data

**Databricks file system (DBFS)**
- distributed file system
- pre-installed in Databrick clusters
- abstraction layer using underlaying cloud storage (eg S3):
	- File created in DBFS in the cluster will store in cloud

**Compute** 
- multi-code - cluster (compose of master node - driver, that coordinating other worker for parallel execution of task, and some other worker nodes)
- single node - no workers and run spark on the driver
