A Dockerfile isÂ **a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image**. This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile.

Example of an dockerfile
```
FROM python:3.9-alpine
EXPOSE 80  //expose container port
RUN pip install pandas   //run when building image (for resource)
WORKDIR /app
COPY pipeline.py pipeline.py
ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "pipeline.py"]
```
